    "Bayes' theorem is used in practice in many different fields, including statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and decision-making. Here are some examples of how it is used in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Medical diagnosis:**Bayes' theorem can be used to calculate the probability of a patient having a disease based on their symptoms and medical history. By updating the prior probability of the disease based on the likelihood of the symptoms given the disease, we can obtain a more accurate diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Spam filtering:** Bayes' theorem can be used to classify emails as spam or not spam. By calculating the probability of an email being spam based on the likelihood of certain words or phrases appearing in the email, we can filter out unwanted messages.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Predictive modeling:** Bayes' theorem can be used to make predictions about future events based on past observations. For example, in weather forecasting, we can update our prior probability of certain weather conditions based on the likelihood of certain atmospheric patterns, in order to make more accurate predictions."

    " - **Bernoulli Naive Bayes:** This classifier is used for binary or boolean input features, where each feature is either present or absent. For example, it could be used for sentiment analysis, where we want to classify a document as positive or negative based on the presence or absence of certain words.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Multinomial Naive Bayes:** This classifier is used for discrete input features that can take on multiple values. For example, it could be used for text classification, where we want to classify documents into categories based on the frequency of certain words.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Gaussian Naive Bayes:** This classifier is used for continuous input features that are normally distributed. For example, it could be used for predicting the price of a house based on its size, location, and other features."
